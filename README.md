# Quiz App

## Purpose
This website is used to quiz someone on general knowledge of coding concepts (Although just simple modifications to the internal Array could make the quiz about anything!) The quiz is timed, and also has a score. The quiz also uses a multiplier to reward players for getting more than one answer in a row right. At the end of the quiz, players will be prompted to play again, or enter their name into the highscores. If they do, they'll be presented with the updated highscores.
